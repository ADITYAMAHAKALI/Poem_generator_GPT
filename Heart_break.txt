My heart is broken, my soul is aching,
My dreams are shattered, my hope is fading.
My heart is heavy, my spirit is low,
My love is gone, and I don't know where to go.

When my heart is broken and my tears won't stop,
Come to me, my lord, and fill me with your love.
When my sorrows are too much to bear,
Come to me, my lord, and show me you care.

When my heart is broken and I'm feeling so low,
Come to me, my lord, and help me to grow.
When my pain is too much to take,
Come to me, my lord, and help me to break.

When my heart is broken and I'm feeling so lost,
Come to me, my lord, and help me to find the cost.
When my dreams are shattered and I'm feeling so blue,
Come to me, my lord, and help me to make it through.

When my heart is broken and I'm feeling so alone,
Come to me, my lord, and help me to find my home.
When my love is gone and I'm feeling so
