Politics, a game of power and control,
Where the people are pawns and the leaders the kings,
Where the masses are silenced and the voices of few are heard,
Where the truth is hidden and lies are spread.

The people are bound by the chains of fear,
Where freedom is a distant dream,
Where the voices of the people are unheard,
And the leaders are the only ones who are seen.

The people are oppressed and their rights denied,
Where the leaders are corrupt and the people are blind,
Where the truth is hidden and lies are spread,
And the people are left with no hope in sight.

The people are struggling for freedom and justice,
Where the leaders are deaf to their cries,
Where the truth is hidden and lies are spread,
And the people are left with no choice but to fight.
