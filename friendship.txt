God has made me known to friends I never knew,
He has given me a place in homes not my own,
He has brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger.

My heart is uneasy when I must leave my home,
But I forget that the old is in the new,
And that God is always with me, wherever I go.

Through birth and death, in this world or in others,
God is always with me, my one companion,
Linking my heart with joy to the unfamiliar.

When one knows God, then no one is a stranger,
No door is shut, no one is ever alone,
Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of His touch.
