I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,
If only in some happy future I am born in India's sacred land.
Where the Taj Mahal stands tall, and the Ganges flows so grand,
Where the sun rises in the east, and the moonlight dances in the sand.

Where the Himalayas reach the sky, and the Thar Desert stretches wide,
Where the people are so kind, and the culture is so alive.
Where the spices fill the air, and the colors fill the streets,
Where the festivals are celebrated, and the music never sleeps.

Where the elephants roam the jungles, and the tigers prowl the night,
Where the peacocks dance in the rain, and the rivers sparkle in the light.
Where the temples are so grand, and the mosques are so divine,
Where the people are so strong, and the faith is so sublime.

Where the tea is so sweet, and the mangoes are so ripe,
Where the mountains are so high, and the valleys are so deep.
Where the culture is so rich, and the history is so vast,
Where the people are so proud, and the future is so blast.
