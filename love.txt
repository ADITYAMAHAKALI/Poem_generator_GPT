She is near to my heart like a meadow-flower to the earth,
A sweet presence that brings me peace and mirth.
My love for her is my life, a river in autumn flood,
A serene flow that carries me through the wood.

My songs are one with my love, a murmuring stream,
That sings with all its waves and current so serene.
My heart is filled with joy, a blissful emotion,
A love that is so strong, a devotion.

My love for her is like a fire, burning bright and true,
A flame that will never die, no matter what I do.
My love for her is like a star, shining in the night,
A beacon of hope, a guiding light.

My love for her is like a song, a melody of joy,
A beautiful harmony that I will always enjoy.
My love for her is like a dream, a vision of delight,
A beautiful fantasy that will never take flight.

My love for her is like a rose, a beauty so divine,
A sweet fragrance that will always be mine.
My love for her is like a blessing, a gift from above,
