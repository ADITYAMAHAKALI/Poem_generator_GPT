The darkness of night is a joke to me,
A laugh that I can't help but see.
The gloom of the sky is a funny sight,
A joke that I can't help but delight.

The trammels of life are a funny thing,
A joke that I can't help but sing.
The shroud of dust and death I embrace,
A joke that I can't help but face.

My debts and failures are a funny thing,
A joke that I can't help but bring.
The wall I build around me is a joke,
A laugh that I can't help but evoke.

The dungeon of tears is a funny sight,
A joke that I can't help but delight.
The gloom of the sky is a funny thing,
A joke that I can't help but sing.
